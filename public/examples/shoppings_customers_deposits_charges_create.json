By the way, the\n`IShoppingCustomer` does not mean a person, but a connection basis. Therefore,\neven if the same person connects to the shopping mall multiple, multiple\nrecords are created in `IShoppingCustomer`.\n\nThe first purpose of this is to track the customer's inflow path in detail,\nand it is for cases where the same person enters as a non-member,\n{@link IShoppingCartCommodity puts items in the shopping cart} in advance,\nand only authenticates their {@link IShoppingCitizen real name} or\nregisters/logs in at the moment of {@link IShoppingOrderPublish payment}.\nIt is the second. Lastly, it is to accurately track the activities that\na person performs at the shopping mall in various ways like below.\n\n- Same person comes from an {@link IShoppingExternalUser external service}\n- Same person creates multiple accounts\n- Same person makes a {@link IShoppingOrderPublish purchase} as a non-member with only {@link IShoppingCitizen real name authentication}\n- Same person acts both {@link IShoppingSeller seller} and {@link IShoppingAdministrator admin} at the same time\n\nTherefore, `IShoppingCustomer` can have multiple records with the same\n{@link IShoppingCitizen}, {@link IShoppingMember}, and\n{@link IShoppingExternalUser}. Additionally, if a customer signs up for\nmembership after verifying their real name or signs up for our service after\nbeing a user of an external service, all related records are changed at once.\nTherefore, identification and tracking of customers can be done very\nsystematically.",
